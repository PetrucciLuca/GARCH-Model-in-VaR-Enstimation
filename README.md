## GARCH-Model-in-VaR-Enstimation
# Application with R

ABSTRACT

In this paper we develop the technique to analyze different extensions of ARCH and GARCHâ€™s family models in market risk estimation, measured by taking into account the '' Value at Risk ''. Then, we develop a list of Markov-Switching GARCH model which enables us to choose which model is adapt for each index and, specify complex GARCH equations in two distinct Markov-re-gimes: high and low volatility. Periods of high volatility are persistent over time and similar periods of relative market quiet. This phenomenon is known as "Volatility Clustering." To give a simple example, we have estimated 1.032 models for each index with the package RUGARCH. With package MSGARCH we have estimated 72 models with Maximum Likehood estimation and 72 with Bayesian estimation. Our empirical study has two major findings. First, our estimation results said that the parsimoniously models are preferred to the other. Second, we have demonstrated the powerful of Markov-switching GARCH models over traditional GARCH family.
